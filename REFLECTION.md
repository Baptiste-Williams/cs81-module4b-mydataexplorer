# Reflection

## Were your predictions right?
Yeah, for the most part. I figured Thursday had the most screen time, and I was right—I was on my phone a lot that day. I also guessed that Wednesday or Sunday would be my best focus days, and that lined up too. I thought caffeine would help me focus, but turns out I was actually more focused on days without it. That surprised me.

## What surprised you?
Definitely the caffeine thing. I assumed if i consumed more caffeine = more focus, but the data said otherwise. Also, I didn’t realize how often I felt “focused” until I saw it show up as my most frequent mood.

## What was tricky or rewarding?
Getting all the functions to work together was a little tricky at first, especially remembering to call them at the bottom. But once I saw the output, it felt really good. It was cool seeing my own habits show up in the results.

## How did using your own data change things?
It made the whole thing feel more real. I wasn’t just writing random code—I was actually learning something about myself. That made it more interesting and way more fun to work on.
